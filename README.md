# My-Portfolio 1.0

##This is my portfolio

PLease note, this was one of my very first projects after joining my bootcamp. I am leaving this project AS IS as a reminder of where I started and where I have gone, simce the beggining. After enjoying a few laughs (as I have done!!) check out my new updated portfolio below.
